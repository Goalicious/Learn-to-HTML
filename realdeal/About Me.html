	<h3> Let me tell you something about me.</h3>
	<p>
	My wife, my kids and I are living in a small town <!--link gmaps?--> with the beautiful name Gierałtowiczki.<br>
	We built a house close to the forest and away from the neighbours and are constantly struggling to keep the garden from overgrowing us.<br>
	<br>
	Have you heard the proverb that you should build the first house for an enemy, the second one for a friend and the third one for yourself? It's pretty acurate.<br>
	Despite having never really done anything more complicated than hanging up a picture, I made most of the finishing inside the house myself. <abbr title="As in: Mistakes were made">And I learned a lot.</abbr><br>
	<br>
	When not tinkering around the house or spending time with the family I am photographing. I prefer to use my analouge cameras. You may ask now "Which cameras do you own?". Let me create a table real quick to answer that question.<br>
</p>

<table border="1"> <!-- links bildersuche?-->
	<tr>
		<td>Nikon FE</td>
		<td>Leica R6</td>
		<td>Zeiss Contina III</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>50mm F1,8</td>
		<td>50mm F2, 90mm F2,8</td>
		<td>45mm F2,8</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>I also like to cook. Would you like to see one of my favorite recipies?</p>
<h3>Kirschmichel</h3>
You need the following things:
<ul>
	<li>1kg pitted <b>Cherries</b></li>
	<li>250g <b>flour</b></li>
	<li>250ml <b>milk</b></li>
	<li>4 <b>eggs</b></li>
	<li>A pinch of <b>salt</b></li>
	<li><abbr title="Depending on your baking dish">About</abbr> 150g of <b>butter</b></li>
	<li><abbr title="Also depending on your baking dish">About</abbr>100g of <b>sugar</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
After gathering the ingredients and pitting the cherries proceed with the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>Turn on the oven at 190°C</li>
	<li>Mix flour, milk, eggs and salt</li>
	<li>Melt the butter and pour &#190 of it in your baking dish</li>
	<li>Spread half of the sugar on the bottom of the dish</li>
	<li>Pour the dough slowly in the dish</li>
	<li>Now it's time for the cherries - let them sink in for a moment</li>
	<li>Put the remaining butter and sugar on top</li>
	<li>Bake for about 30 Minutes and serve hot</li>
</ol>
A green salad with buttermilk dressing fits very nicely.
